      "\n",
      "First, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right: f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). So, for each x value, I plug it into the numerator and denominator and simplify. Let's start with f(-2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculating f(-2):\n",
      "The numerator is 3*(-2) - 2. Let me compute that: 3 times -2 is -6, and then subtract 2, so that's -6 - 2 = -8.\n",
      "The denominator is (-2) - 2, which is -4.\n",
      "So, f(-2) is (-8)/(-4). Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that's 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, f(-1):\n",
      "Numerator: 3*(-1) - 2. 3 times -1 is -3, minus 2 is -5.\n",
      "Denominator: (-1) - 2, which is -3.\n",
      "So, f(-1) is (-5)/(-3). Again, two negatives make a positive, so that's 5/3. Hmm, 5/3 is approximately 1.666..., but I'll keep it as a fraction for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, f(0):\n",
      "Numerator: 3*0 - 2. That's 0 - 2 = -2.\n",
      "Denominator: 0 - 2 = -2.\n",
      "So, f(0) is (-2)/(-2). That simplifies to 1. Easy enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, now I have f(-2) = 2, f(-1) = 5/3, and f(0) = 1. I need to add these together: 2 + 5/3 + 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me convert these to fractions with a common denominator to add them up. The denominators I have are 1, 3, and 1. So, the common denominator is 3.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

      "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). It's a 10th-degree polynomial, so there should be 10 roots, right? And they're all complex because it's a high-degree polynomial. The problem says the roots come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). \n",

So each term is the reciprocal of the product of a root and its conjugate. I remember that for a complex number \\(r\\), \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is just the square of its modulus, \\(|r|^2\\).

      "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the distances from four intersection points of two graphs to the point (-3, 2). The two graphs are given by the equations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \\( x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0 \\)\n",

      "Hmm, let me try to figure out what these graphs are. The first equation looks like a circle because it has \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y^2 \\) terms with the same coefficient. Let me rewrite it in standard form by completing the squares.\n",

      "Starting with the first equation:\n",

      "\\( x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "Group the x terms and y terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\( (x^2 + 6x) + (y^2 - 24y) = -72 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, complete the square for x:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\( x^2 + 6x \\) becomes \\( (x + 3)^2 - 9 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "And for y:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\( y^2 - 24y \\) becomes \\( (y - 12)^2 - 144 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "So plugging these back in:\n",

      "\\( (x + 3)^2 - 9 + (y - 12)^2 - 144 = -72 \\)\n",
      "\n",

      "\\( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 - 153 = -72 \\)\n",

      "\n",
      "\\( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81 \\)\n",

      "\\( (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -9 \\)\n",

      "\\( \\frac{(y - 8)^2}{9} - \\frac{(x + 3)^2}{9} = 1 \\)\n",

      "Okay, so I need to find the median number of students for each of these eight counties in the year 2005. Hmm, let me make sure I understand what a median is. The median is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. Since there are eight counties, which is an even number, the median will be the average of the fourth and fifth numbers when the data is ordered from least to greatest.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should extract the 2005 student numbers for each county. Let me list them out:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Aiken: 136\n",
      "- Bamberg: 11\n",
      "- Barnwell: 29\n",
      "- Berkeley: 524\n",
      "- Calhoun: 11\n",
      "- Cherokee: 19\n",
      "- Chesterfield: 29\n",
      "- Colleton: 41\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. From the table:\n",
      "\n",
      "Aiken: 136\n",
      "\n",
      "Bamberg: 11\n",
      "\n",
      "Barnwell: 29\n",
      "\n",
      "Berkeley: 524\n",
      "\n",
      "Calhoun: 11\n",
      "\n",
      "Cherokee: 19\n",
      "\n",
      "Chesterfield: 29\n",
      "\n",
      "Colleton: 41\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that looks right. So now I have these numbers: 136, 11, 29, 524, 11, 19, 29, 41.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to arrange these numbers in order from smallest to largest. Let me do that step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the smallest number is 11. There are two counties with 11 students: Bamberg and Calhoun. Next, the next smallest number is 19, which is Cherokee. Then, 29 appears twice: Barnwell and Chesterfield. After that, 41 is Colleton. Then, 136 is Aiken. Finally, the largest number is 524, which is Berkeley.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, ordering them: 11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me write that out:\n",

      "2. 11\n",
      "3. 19\n",
      "4. 29\n",
      "5. 29\n",
      "6. 41\n",
      "7. 136\n",
      "8. 524\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there are eight counties, the median will be the average of the fourth and fifth numbers. The fourth number is 29, and the fifth number is also 29.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the median is (29 + 29) divided by 2, which is 58 divided by 2, which equals 29.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the median number of students in 2005 is 29.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in ordering. Let me list them again:\n",
      "\n",
      "11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's correct. The fourth and fifth numbers are both 29, so the median is 29.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a possibility that I missed a number or ordered them incorrectly? Let me check each county again:\n",
      "\n",
      "Aiken: 136 – that's the highest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Berkeley: 524 – that's the second highest.\n",

      "Colleton: 41 – that's the sixth.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bamberg: 11 – second.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calhoun: 11 – first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, hold on, when I ordered them, I put Calhoun first, but in the list, Calhoun is 11, Bamberg is 11. So, in the ordered list, the first two are 11s, then 19, then 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that seems correct.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r = sqrt(x² + y²). And θ is found using the arctangent function, θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) isn't enough because it doesn't account for the correct quadrant. So, I need to consider the signs of x and y to determine the correct angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the point (0, 3), x is 0 and y is 3. Let me plug these into the formula for r. So, r = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, that seems straightforward. So, r is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto θ. Since x is 0, I need to be careful because dividing by zero is undefined. I remember that when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. In this case, y is positive, so the point is on the positive y-axis. What angle does that correspond to? Well, on the unit circle, the positive y-axis is at π/2 radians or 90 degrees. So, θ should be π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me double-check using the arctangent formula. θ = arctan(y/x). Here, y is 3 and x is 0, so θ = arctan(3/0). Hmm, 3 divided by 0 is undefined, but I know that arctan approaches π/2 as the input approaches infinity. Since 3/0 is essentially infinity, θ should be π/2. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes when x is 0, we have to be extra careful. For example, if x is 0 and y is positive, it's π/2; if x is 0 and y is negative, it's 3π/2. So, in this case, since y is positive, θ is definitely π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me visualize this point on the coordinate plane. The point (0, 3) is straight up along the y-axis, three units above the origin. So, the radius r is just the distance from the origin to that point, which is 3 units. The angle θ is measured from the positive x-axis to the point, going counterclockwise. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, that angle is a right angle, which is π/2 radians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the unit circle. On the unit circle, the point (0, 1) corresponds to an angle of π/2. Since our point is (0, 3), it's just three times as far from the origin, but the angle remains the same because it's still on the same line. So, the angle doesn't change, only the radius does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also recall that in polar coordinates, θ is typically measured in radians, and it's important that it falls within the range [0, 2π). In this case, π/2 is already within that range, so we don't need to adjust it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me convert the polar coordinates back to rectangular coordinates and see if I get (0, 3). The formulas for conversion are x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. So, plugging in r = 3 and θ = π/2:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = 3 cos(π/2) = 3 * 0 = 0\n",
      "\n",
      "y = 3 sin(π/2) = 3 * 1 = 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that gives me (0, 3), which is exactly the point I started with. So, that confirms that my conversion is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've got it. The polar coordinates are (3, π/2). But just to recap the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Calculate r using r = sqrt(x² + y²). For (0, 3), that's sqrt(0 + 9) = 3.\n",
      "2. Determine θ. Since x is 0 and y is positive, θ is π/2.\n",
      "3. Verify by converting back to rectangular coordinates, which gives me the original point.\n",

      "\n",
      "Is there any other consideration I need to make? For example, sometimes when both x and y are zero, θ is undefined, but in this case, x is zero and y is non-zero, so θ is clearly π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: sometimes, when converting, especially when x is zero, people might confuse θ with something else, but in this case, it's straightforward because it's on the y-axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've covered all the bases here. I calculated r, determined θ, checked my work by converting back, and made sure that θ is within the required range. So, I think I'm good.\n",

      "Is there a possibility that θ could be represented in another form? For example, sometimes angles can be represented in different ways by adding multiples of 2π, but since θ needs to be between 0 and 2π, π/2 is the only correct representation here.\n",

      "Is there a chance I could have messed up the angle? For example, if I thought it was 3π/2, but that would be on the negative y-axis, which is not the case here. So, no, π/2 is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it: in the unit circle, 0 radians is along the positive x-axis, π/2 is up the y-axis, π is along the negative x-axis, and 3π/2 is down the y-axis. So, (0, 3) is definitely at π/2.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r = sqrt(x² + y²). And θ is found using the arctangent function, θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) isn't enough because it doesn't account for the correct quadrant. So, I need to consider the signs of x and y to determine the correct angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the point (0, 3), x is 0 and y is 3. Let me plug these into the formula for r. So, r = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, that seems straightforward. So, r is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto θ. Since x is 0, I need to be careful because dividing by zero is undefined. I remember that when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. In this case, y is positive, so the point is on the positive y-axis. What angle does that correspond to? Well, on the unit circle, the positive y-axis is at π/2 radians or 90 degrees. So, θ should be π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me double-check using the arctangent formula. θ = arctan(y/x). Here, y is 3 and x is 0, so θ = arctan(3/0). Hmm, 3 divided by 0 is undefined, but I know that arctan approaches π/2 as the input approaches infinity. Since 3/0 is essentially infinity, θ should be π/2. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes when x is 0, we have to be extra careful. For example, if x is 0 and y is positive, it's π/2; if x is 0 and y is negative, it's 3π/2. So, in this case, since y is positive, θ is definitely π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me visualize this point on the coordinate plane. The point (0, 3) is straight up along the y-axis, three units above the origin. So, the radius r is just the distance from the origin to that point, which is 3 units. The angle θ is measured from the positive x-axis to the point, going counterclockwise. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, that angle is a right angle, which is π/2 radians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the unit circle. On the unit circle, the point (0, 1) corresponds to an angle of π/2. Since our point is (0, 3), it's just three times as far from the origin, but the angle remains the same because it's still on the same line. So, the angle doesn't change, only the radius does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also recall that in polar coordinates, θ is typically measured in radians, and it's important that it falls within the range [0, 2π). In this case, π/2 is already within that range, so we don't need to adjust it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me convert the polar coordinates back to rectangular coordinates and see if I get (0, 3). The formulas for conversion are x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. So, plugging in r = 3 and θ = π/2:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = 3 cos(π/2) = 3 * 0 = 0\n",
      "\n",
      "y = 3 sin(π/2) = 3 * 1 = 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that gives me (0, 3), which is exactly the point I started with. So, that confirms that my conversion is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've got it. The polar coordinates are (3, π/2). But just to recap the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Calculate r using r = sqrt(x² + y²). For (0, 3), that's sqrt(0 + 9) = 3.\n",
      "2. Determine θ. Since x is 0 and y is positive, θ is π/2.\n",
      "3. Verify by converting back to rectangular coordinates, which gives me the original point.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I feel confident that the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Answer**\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--------\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, hold on. The problem says to enter the answer in the form (r, θ), with r > 0 and 0 ≤ θ < 2π. I think I did that. r is 3, which is positive, and θ is π/2, which is between 0 and 2π. So, that should be correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any other consideration I need to make? For example, sometimes when both x and y are zero, θ is undefined, but in this case, x is zero and y is non-zero, so θ is clearly π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: sometimes, when converting, especially when x is zero, people might confuse θ with something else, but in this case, it's straightforward because it's on the y-axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've covered all the bases here. I calculated r, determined θ, checked my work by converting back, and made sure that θ is within the required range. So, I think I'm good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a possibility that θ could be represented in another form? For example, sometimes angles can be represented in different ways by adding multiples of 2π, but since θ needs to be between 0 and 2π, π/2 is the only correct representation here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, just to think about the direction: since the point is on the positive y-axis, moving counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, it's a quarter turn, which is π/2 radians. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've thought through all the possible angles and made sure that my answer is correct. So, I think I'm confident that (3, π/2) is the correct polar coordinate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a chance I could have messed up the angle? For example, if I thought it was 3π/2, but that would be on the negative y-axis, which is not the case here. So, no, π/2 is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to think about it: in the unit circle, 0 radians is along the positive x-axis, π/2 is up the y-axis, π is along the negative x-axis, and 3π/2 is down the y-axis. So, (0, 3) is definitely at π/2.\n",

      "I think I've covered all the possible doubts. So, I think my answer is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, hold on, the problem says to enter the answer in the form (r, θ). So, I should write it as (3, π/2). But in the final answer, I need to put it inside a box and using LaTeX. So, I should write it as \\boxed{(3, \\dfrac{\\pi}{2})}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's correct.\n",

      "So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2), which in boxed form is \\boxed{(3, \\dfrac{\\pi}{2})}.\n",

      "So, that's the final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, just to make sure, let me think about another point on the y-axis. For example, (0, 1) is (1, π/2) in polar coordinates, and (0, 5) is (5, π/2). So, yeah, regardless of how far up the y-axis you go, the angle remains π/2, and the radius is just the distance from the origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in this case, since the point is (0, 3), the radius is 3, and the angle is π/2. So, that's consistent.\n",

       "\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \\n\\nFirst, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r = sqrt(x² + y²). And θ is found using the arctangent function, θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) isn't enough because it doesn't account for the correct quadrant. So, I need to consider the signs of x and y to determine the correct angle.\\n\\nLooking at the point (0, 3), x is 0 and y is 3. Let me plug these into the formula for r. So, r = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, that seems straightforward. So, r is 3.\\n\\nNow, onto θ. Since x is 0, I need to be careful because dividing by zero is undefined. I remember that when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. In this case, y is positive, so the point is on the positive y-axis. What angle does that correspond to? Well, on the unit circle, the positive y-axis is at π/2 radians or 90 degrees. So, θ should be π/2.\\n\\nBut let me double-check using the arctangent formula. θ = arctan(y/x). Here, y is 3 and x is 0, so θ = arctan(3/0). Hmm, 3 divided by 0 is undefined, but I know that arctan approaches π/2 as the input approaches infinity. Since 3/0 is essentially infinity, θ should be π/2. That makes sense.\\n\\nWait, but sometimes when x is 0, we have to be extra careful. For example, if x is 0 and y is positive, it's π/2; if x is 0 and y is negative, it's 3π/2. So, in this case, since y is positive, θ is definitely π/2.\\n\\nLet me visualize this point on the coordinate plane. The point (0, 3) is straight up along the y-axis, three units above the origin. So, the radius r is just the distance from the origin to that point, which is 3 units. The angle θ is measured from the positive x-axis to the point, going counterclockwise. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, that angle is a right angle, which is π/2 radians.\\n\\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using the unit circle. On the unit circle, the point (0, 1) corresponds to an angle of π/2. Since our point is (0, 3), it's just three times as far from the origin, but the angle remains the same because it's still on the same line. So, the angle doesn't change, only the radius does.\\n\\nLet me also recall that in polar coordinates, θ is typically measured in radians, and it's important that it falls within the range [0, 2π). In this case, π/2 is already within that range, so we don't need to adjust it.\\n\\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me convert the polar coordinates back to rectangular coordinates and see if I get (0, 3). The formulas for conversion are x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. So, plugging in r = 3 and θ = π/2:\\n\\nx = 3 cos(π/2) = 3 * 0 = 0\\n\\ny = 3 sin(π/2) = 3 * 1 = 3\\n\\nYes, that gives me (0, 3), which is exactly the point I started with. So, that confirms that my conversion is correct.\\n\\nI think I've got it. The polar coordinates are (3, π/2). But just to recap the steps:\\n\\n1. Calculate r using r = sqrt(x² + y²). For (0, 3), that's sqrt(0 + 9) = 3.\\n2. Determine θ. Since x is 0 and y is positive, θ is π/2.\\n3. Verify by converting back to rectangular coordinates, which gives me the original point.\\n\\nSo, I feel confident that the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe polar coordinates are \\\\boxed{(3, \\\\dfrac{\\\\pi}{2})}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo convert the rectangular coordinate \\\\((0, 3)\\\\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates \\\\((x, y)\\\\) to polar coordinates \\\\((r, \\\\theta)\\\\).\\n\\n1.
